            VIDEO DOWNLOADER ADDENDUM TO iQ MEDIA SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT</h4>
        <p>
            <i>Last Updated:   October 14, 2015</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            This addendum (“Addendum”) to the iQ Media Subscription Agreement (“Subscription Agreement”) between iQ Media Group Inc. 
            (“iQ Media”) and Customer (as defined in the Subscription Agreement) provides additional terms and conditions for the 
            optional downloading feature of iQ Media’s media intelligence and research services (“Downloader Service”) ordered by 
            Customer or as provided in the applicable Service Order.  All capitalized terms used in this Addendum which are not 
            defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Subscription Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Downloader Service is available upon request to broadcasters, newspapers, or other media or publications solely to 
            support their mission of news reporting, commentary, criticism, and analysis in a manner that is consistent with the 
            copyright and other applicable laws of the United States and any other applicable jurisdiction.      
        </p>
        <p>
            1. <u>License</u>.  In addition to the license granted by iQ Media to Customer in the Subscription Agreement, iQ Media 
            grants Customer a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license during the term of each Service Order (as defined 
            in the Subscription Agreement) to access and use the Downloader Service to download media content in the iQ Media 
            database (“Downloaded Content”) in the categories specified in such Service Order, solely for purposes of (i) internal, 
            time-shifted viewing related to news reporting, commentary and analysis, and (ii) external fair uses as described in 
            the next sentence, and not for sale or licensing.  If Customer makes Downloaded Content available outside its organization, 
            Customer will distribute or display the Downloaded Content solely in conjunction with such news reporting, commentary and 
            analysis as is sufficient to make Customer’s use of the Downloaded Content a fair use or otherwise permissible under the 
            laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction.  Customer will not reproduce, display, perform, create 
            derivative works of, or distribute Downloaded Content except as permitted by this Addendum. Certain channels and media 
            outlets may not be available with the Downloader Service from time to time. In the event that iQ Media's provision of the 
            functionality in the Downloader Service is subsequently determined to be negligent or infringing, Customer’s obligations 
            under Section 2 of this Addendum are still applicable to its actions and usage described in described in this Section 1.       
        </p>
        <p>
            2.  <u>Indemnity</u>.  In addition to the Customer’s indemnification obligations under the Subscription Agreement, Customer 
            shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless iQ Media, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, 
            members, managers, employees and agents from all losses and legal expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) related to 
            any third-party claim, action or allegation that arises from Customer’s breach of this Addendum or use of the Downloader Service.       
        </p>
        <p>
            3.  <u>Warranties and Disclaimers</u>.  Customer represents and warrants that it (i) is a broadcaster, newspaper, or other 
            media or publishing organization, and (ii) has consulted with counsel about its proposed use of the Downloader Service and 
            has been advised that such use is a fair use or is otherwise legally permissible under copyright and other applicable laws.  
            iQ Media makes no warranties as to any use of the Downloader Service and, notwithstanding anything in the Subscription 
            Agreement to the contrary, shall have no liability whatsoever related to the Downloaded Content.      
        </p>
        <p>
            4.  <u>Conflicting Terms</u>.  If there is a conflict between the terms of the Subscription Agreement and this Addendum, 
            this Addendum will govern.

            This addendum (“Addendum”) to the iQ Media Subscription Agreement (“Subscription Agreement”) between iQ Media Group Inc. 
            (“iQ Media”) and Customer (as defined in the Subscription Agreement) provides additional terms and conditions for the optional 
            content sharing feature of iQ Media’s media intelligence and research services (“Publisher Service”) ordered by Customer as 
            provided in the applicable Service Order. All capitalized terms used in this Addendum which are not defined herein shall have 
            the meanings set forth in the Subscription Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Publisher Service is available upon request to iQ Media customers solely for uses related to research, news reporting, 
            commentary, criticism, and analysis in a manner that is consistent with the copyright and other applicable laws of the 
            United States and any other applicable jurisdiction.          
        </p>
        <p>
            1. <u>License</u>.  In addition to the license granted by iQ Media to Customer in the Subscription Agreement, iQ Media grants 
            Customer a limited, non-transferable, revocable, non-sublicensable license during the term of each Service Order to access 
            and use the Publisher Service to embed the iQ Media content player technology provided by iQ Media in emails and on Customer 
            or third party websites to create viewable links to content in the categories specified in the Service Order (“Shared Content”), 
            solely for purposes of research, news reporting, commentary, criticism and analysis constituting fair uses under applicable 
            copyright laws, and not for sale or licensing. Customer will not create, reproduce, display, perform, use, create derivative 
            works of, distribute, or share Shared Content except as permitted by this Addendum. Certain channels and media outlets may not 
            be available with the Publisher Service from time to time.          
        </p>
        <p>
            2.  <u>Termination</u>.  iQ Media, in its sole discretion, may immediately and without notice suspend or terminate access to 
            the Publisher Service, including suspending or terminating Shared Content already embedded on Customer or third party websites, 
            if iQ Media receives a complaint from a rights holder about Customer or believes in good faith that Customer has breached this 
            Addendum or the Subscription Agreement. iQ Media shall have no liability whatsoever relating to any suspension, denial or 
            termination of access to the Publisher Service or Shared Content.        
        </p>
        <p>
            3.  <u>Indemnity</u>.  In addition to the Customer’s indemnification obligations under the Subscription Agreement, Customer 
            shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless iQ Media, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, 
            members, managers, employees and agents from all losses and legal expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) related to 
            any third-party claim, action or allegation that arises from Customer’s breach of this Addendum or use of the Publisher Service. 
            Notwithstanding anything in the Subscription Agreement to the contrary, iQ Media shall have no liability whatsoever related to 
            Shared Content.       
        </p>
        <p>
            4.  <u>Warranties and Disclaimers</u>.  Customer represents and warrants that it has consulted with counsel about its uses of 
            the Publisher Service and has been advised that such uses comply with copyright and all other applicable laws. iQ Media makes 
            no warranties as to any use of the Publisher Service.       
        </p>
        <p>
            5.  <u>Conflicting Terms</u>.  If there is a conflict between the terms of the Subscription Agreement and this Addendum, 
            this Addendum will govern.

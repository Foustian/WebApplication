                        <p class="small-text">
                            We collect Personal Information in connection with our Service, but we do not collect
                            any more information than reasonably needed to offer the Service. When we use the
                            term “Personal Information” we mean information that can be used to identify an
                            individual or is combined with individually identifiable information and may include
                            your first and last name, by itself or combined with your email address, postal
                            address, unique device identifiers and other unique identifiers (such as login information),
                            telephone number and/or searches and clips made by you through our Service. On occasion,
                            we may also collect Personal Information about third parties who may not be direct
                            users of the Service, including Personal Information about your clients (“Clients”)
                            and media contacts, but only if our users choose to provide it to us through the
                            Service. Any time you share a third party’s Personal Information with us, you agree
                            that you will have obtained all legally required consent from the third party to
                            do so and for us to store such information through the Service on your behalf as
                            described in this Privacy Statement.</p>
                        <p class="small-text">
                            “Personal Information” also includes any credit card or debit card or other financial
                            account information you may provide to us or to our third-party payment provider
                            for billing purposes. We may send billing and payment information, including any

                            Generally, our platform software is configured to enable you to give you or your
                            Clients the means to access their own personal information for the purposes of deleting
                            it and/or correcting it. In the alternative, you have a right to contact us to access
                            certain personal records we hold about you. This is called a “subject access request”,
                            which you can make by writing to iQ Media Group Inc., 1001 East Hector Street, Suite 401, 
                            Conshohocken, PA 19428. A fee may be payable by you if you make any requests that would require
                            a disproportionate effort on our part, but we will not charge you until we have
                            told you how much the fee is and what it is for, and you have told us you still
                            want to proceed.</p>
                        <p class="small-text">
                            We ask individual contacting us about their Personal Information to identify themselves
                            and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing
                            such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive
                            or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy
                            of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning
                            information residing on backups), or for which access is not otherwise required.
                            In any case, where we provide information access and correction, we perform this
                            service free of charge, unless responding to your request would require a disproportionate
                            effort.</p>

                            information to users as they move from screen to screen. These cookies are “session-specific”
                            and are not used to record personal information. They are used to that only authenticated
                            users can navigate the application. iQ media users who disable their Web browsers’

                        <p class="small-text">
                            A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom
                            she or he has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household
                            purposes (“California Customer”) is entitled to request information about whether
                            the business has disclosed her or his Personal Information to any third parties
                            for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has
                            made such a disclosure of Personal Information, upon receipt of a request by a California
                            Customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom
                            Personal Information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a
                            list of the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed.</p>
                        <p class="small-text">
                            However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described
                            lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its Privacy Statement)
                            a policy of not disclosing customer’s Personal Information to third parties for
                            their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to
                            the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather,
                            the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right
                            to prevent disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for direct marketing
                            purposes and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.</p>
                        <p class="small-text">
                            Currently, we do not share your Personal Information with third parties for their
                            own direct marketing purposes.</p>

            SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT</h4>
        <p>
            <i>Last Updated:   August 12, 2016</i></p>

        <p>
            THIS SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT (“AGREEMENT”) IS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT
            BETWEEN iQ MEDIA GROUP INC (“IQ MEDIA”) AND THE PERSON OR ENTITY
            (“CUSTOMER”) ORDERING iQ MEDIA’S SERVICES, AND GOVERNS THE PROVISION AND
            USE OF SUCH SERVICES.
        </p>
        <p>
            BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, EITHER BY CLICKING A BOX INDICATING
            ACCEPTANCE OR BY AGREEING TO A QUOTATION (A “SERVICE ORDER”) THAT
            REFERENCES THIS AGREEMENT, CUSTOMER AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS
            AGREEMENT. IF THE PERSON ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT IS ENTERING INTO IT ON
            BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, SUCH PERSON REPRESENTS AND
            WARRANTS THAT HE OR SHE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY TO THIS
            AGREEMENT, IN WHICH CASE THE TERM “CUSTOMER” SHALL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY.
            IF THE PERSON ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY OR
            DOES NOT AGREE WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THEN HE OR SHE MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS
            AGREEMENT AND CUSTOMER MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES. BY ACCEPTING THIS
            AGREEMENT IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED ABOVE, CUSTOMER INTENDS TO BE
            LEGALLY BOUND BY THE TERMS HEREOF.         
        </p>
        <p>
            1. <u>Services, Service Orders and Pricing</u>.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
            and any applicable Service Order(s) (which are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by
            reference), Customer hereby subscribes for access to iQ Media’s media intelligence and research
            services. The product features and accessible media types, as well as the fees and payment
            schedule for the services, shall be specified in each Service Order. A Service Order must be
            mutually executed by both parties to be binding and effective. At any time, Customer may also
            request iQ Media to perform custom or specialty services not included in iQ Media’s standard
            service offerings for Customer’s level of access; the features, pricing and any additional terms
            applicable to such services shall be specified in one or more “Custom Service Orders,” which
            shall be effective upon mutual execution by the parties. Upon execution of a Service Order, any
            additional terms appearing or referenced in the Service Order shall be incorporated in this
            Agreement by reference. Customer may subscribe to additional iQ Media features or services
            (such as content exportation, or iQ Media’s fliQ TM platform and services for editing, sharing and
            tracking user generated video content) (collectively, the “Additional Services”) by entering into a
            Service Order specifying the applicable features, fees and payment schedule for the Additional
            Services. The Additional Services are subject to additional terms and conditions as referenced in
            the Service Order (such additional terms and conditions may take the form of either a separate
            agreement or an addendum to this Agreement, and upon their mutual agreement by the parties,
            they are hereby incorporated by reference), as referenced in the Service Order. The services
            ordered by Customer from time to time and described in the Service Orders and Custom Service
            Orders, including Additional Services, are collectively referred to as the “Services.”          
        </p>
        <p>
            2.  <u>Payment</u>.  Payments shall be made within thirty (30) days of the receipt of an invoice from iQ
            Media. Payments shall be made to iQ Media’s Billing Department, with an address of <b>1001 East
            Hector Street, Suite 401, Conshohocken, PA 19428</b>. Unless otherwise stated, iQ Media's fees
            do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature,
            including but not limited to value-added, sales and use, or withholding taxes, assessable by any
            local, state, provincial, federal or foreign jurisdiction (collectively, "Taxes"). Customer is
            responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases of Services hereunder. If iQ Media
            has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this
            paragraph, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by Customer, unless Customer
            provides iQ Media with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing
            authority. However, iQ Media is solely responsible for Taxes assessable against it based on its
            net income, property and employees. Returned or late payments may be subject to additional
            fees. If Customer fails to make any required payment, Customer shall also reimburse iQ Media
            for its reasonable costs of collection.  
        </p>
        <p>
            3.  <u>License</u>.  (a) iQ Media grants Customer a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license
            during the term of each Service Order to (i) access and use those features and functions of iQ
            Media’s proprietary online research platform specified in the applicable Service Order to search,
            and create, store and view clips of, media content in the categories specified in such Service
            Order, all solely for the purpose of time-shifted internal viewing and not for sale, licensing, re-
            broadcast, distribution, syndication or public display; and (ii) use iQ Media’s proprietary analytics
            platform to request media content data summaries to be used for Customer’s internal business
            purposes. Without limiting the foregoing, Customer shall NOT grant third parties access to the
            Services, the iQ Media content database or any content obtained from the database, or use the
            Services for service bureau-type activities, including using the Services on behalf of Customer’s
            clients. Customer’s license to access iQ Media’s platform and database is limited to the number
            of seats purchased by Customer. Each seat will be assigned an individual login and password.
            Each login and password may not be used by anyone within Customer’s organization other than
            the licensed user and may not be shared with any third party.    
        </p>
        <p>
            (b) Under no circumstances may Customer exceed (or permit a third party to exceed) the level of
            access granted in the Service Order, or access or use content, features or functionality in the iQ
            Media platform or database that are not authorized for Customer’s level of access as provided in
            the Service Order(s) and this Agreement, including any additional terms for Additional Services
            Customer has ordered.   
        </p>
        <p>
            (c) Customer shall immediately report to iQ Media any unauthorized access of a login and shall
            be responsible for all activities occurring under each login, whether authorized or not. Customer is
            solely responsible for complying with this Section 3 and applicable copyright and other laws and
            shall not use, copy, modify, re-broadcast, distribute, perform or display media content in any
            infringing or illegal manner.      
        </p>
        <p>
            4. <u>Fair Use Notice; Complaints and Improper Uses</u>. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT iQ
            MEDIA IS AN ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDER ONLY, DOES NOT SELL, DISTRIBUTE OR SYNDICATE CONTENT AND DOES 
            NOT OWN THE MEDIA CONTENT ACCESSIBLE IN THE iQ MEDIA DATABASE. ALL VIEWING, CLIPPING, STORAGE, AND 
            OTHER USAGE OF CONTENT IS STRICTLY LIMITED TO “FAIR USES” UNDER COPYRIGHT LAW. IF CUSTOMER’S INTENDED 
            USAGE OF CONTENT MAY NOT CONSTITUTE “FAIR USE”, iQ MEDIA STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT CUSTOMER CONTACT 
            THE RELEVANT RIGHTS HOLDER TO OBTAIN A SUITABLE LICENSE IN SUCH CONTENT. In order to protect rights
            holders, iQ Media uses digital rights management technology (“DRM”) to monitor and trace the
            usage and sharing of clips and block potentially infringing activities. Customer shall not
            circumvent or disable iQ Media’s DRM, and Customer agrees that iQ Media, in its sole discretion,
            may immediately and without notice suspend or terminate access to any or all of the Services or
            clipped content if (a) Customer fails to pay any amount due under this Agreement; or (b) iQ Media
            receives a complaint from a rights holder about Customer or believes in good faith that Customer
            has breached this Agreement. iQ Media shall have no liability whatsoever relating to any suspension, 
            denial or termination of access to the Services or content where permitted by this Agreement.     
        </p>
        <p>
            5. <u>Confidentiality and Proprietary Rights</u>. Customer agrees to keep confidential and not to
            disclose to any third party, except as expressly permitted in this Agreement or with iQ Media’s
            prior written consent, iQ Media’s proprietary media player technology, media monitoring, clipping
            and business logic platforms, media content data summaries, and all other non-public business or
            technical information relating to the Services (collectively, together with any modifications,
            improvements, updates and customizations thereof, the “iQ Media Materials”), which Customer
            acknowledges constitute iQ Media’s proprietary information and trade secrets. Title to the
            Services and the iQ Media Materials (excluding the underlying media content) is at all times
            owned by iQ Media, along with all trademarks, service marks and trade names used with the iQ
            Media Materials and the Services and all associated goodwill. Customer agrees (i) not to copy,
            distribute, modify, display, de-compile, disassemble or reverse-engineer the Services or the iQ
            Media Materials, or combine or merge them with any other product, service or materials, without
            iQ Media’s prior written consent; and (ii) that any permitted copies shall bear iQ Media’s
            proprietary notices as appearing in the original material. iQ Media may refer to Customer by
            name and logo as a customer in its promotional material, but otherwise shall not use Customer’s
            trademarks or logos in any promotional material or public communication without Customer’s
            prior written approval (except as required by law). All rights relating to intellectual property which
            are not expressly granted to the other party in this Agreement are reserved.      
        </p>
        <p>
            6.  <u>Term and Termination</u>. This Agreement shall continue in force until terminated by either party
            in accordance with this Section 6. Unless different term provisions are specified in a Service
            Order, the initial term of each Service Order is twelve (12) months, after which the Service Order
            will automatically renew for successive additional terms of twelve (12) months, at iQ Media’s
            then-current pricing for any ongoing Services if previously communicated by iQ Media, unless
            either party gives the other notice of non-renewal at least sixty (60) days before the renewal date.
            iQ Media may terminate this Agreement or any Service Order hereunder upon thirty (30) days’
            prior written notice to Customer if Customer materially breaches the terms of either this
            Agreement or such Service Order and such breach is not cured within the notice period; provided,
            however, that iQ Media may terminate immediately without prior notice in the circumstances
            described in Section 3 and 4 above. Customer may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30)
            days’ prior written notice to iQ Media if iQ Media materially breaches the terms of this Agreement
            and such breach is not cured within the notice period; however, if there is more than one Service
            Order outstanding and a breach relates only to the Services provided under a particular Service
            Order, then Customer may terminate that Service Order but not other outstanding Service Orders
            which iQ Media has not breached. Any termination of this Agreement shall cause all outstanding
            Service Orders hereunder to terminate automatically. Promptly upon any termination of this
            Agreement, Customer shall return or destroy all copies and embodiments of iQ Media Materials
            of any type in its possession. iQ Media may retain and use all materials created on its platforms
            using the Services. The ownership, confidentiality, proprietary rights, indemnification, disclaimer,
            limitation of liability and miscellaneous provisions of this Agreement shall survive any termination,
            along with any other provisions hereof that, by their nature, are intended to survive.        
        </p>
        <p>
            7.  <u>Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability</u>. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITH NO
            REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES 
            OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER
            HARMFUL CODE, ACCURACY, TIMELINESS AND ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED OPERATION. IN NO EVENT WILL iQ MEDIA 
            BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR
            PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE OR DATA, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES, 
            EVEN IF iQ MEDIA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES. iQ MEDIA’S ENTIRE 
            LIABILITY, AND CUSTOMER’S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, FOR ANY CLAIM OR ACTION (OR SERIES OF CLAIMS OR ACTIONS) 
            RELATING TO THE SERVICES (WHETHER IN NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION), SHALL 
            BE DIRECT DAMAGES NOT TO EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, THE AMOUNTS PAID BY CUSTOMER TO iQ MEDIA UNDER
            THE SERVICE ORDER(S) TO WHICH THE CLAIM OR ACTION RELATES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING 
            SUCH CLAIM OR ACTION.      
        </p>
        <p>
            8.  <u>Indemnity</u>. Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless iQ Media, its affiliates, and
            their respective officers, directors, shareholders, members, managers, employees and agents
            from all losses and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) related to any third-party
            claim, action or allegation that arises from Customer’s breach of this Agreement or use of the
            Services.  
        </p>
        <p>
            9.  <u>Amendments</u>.  iQ Media may update this Subscription Agreement (but not the specific terms
            of a Service Order) from time to time by e-mailing an updated version to Customer or e-mailing
            Customer a notice that an updated version of this Subscription Agreement is available on iQ
            Media’s website associated with the Services (currently <a href="http://www.iqmediacorp.com" target="_blank">www.iqmediacorp.com</a>). 
            Any updates shall become effective thirty (30) days after notice is sent in this manner. If Customer 
            objects to the new terms, it must notify iQ Media in writing within the thirty (30) day period; if 
            Customer fails to do so and continues to use the Services, it shall be deemed to have accepted the 
            updated version of this Subscription Agreement. If Customer does notify iQ Media of objections within 
            the thirty (30) day notice period, then the existing version of this Subscription Agreement shall
            continue to apply to any outstanding Service Orders for their remaining terms. However, if
            Customer subsequently elects to allow any Service Order to renew, then the Service Order shall
            be governed by the then-current updated version of this Subscription Agreement during the
            renewal term. Likewise, any new Service Order agreed to by Customer will be governed by the
            updated Subscription Agreement.       
        </p>
        <p>
            10.  <u>Miscellaneous</u>. This Agreement (including the Service Orders and additional terms
            referenced herein) is the complete and entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all
            prior and contemporaneous agreements and communications with respect to the subject matter
            hereof (provided, however, that if Customer has previously entered into a separate subscription
            agreement for the fliQ Services, such agreement shall remain in effect with respect to the fliQ
            Services only). In the event of a conflict between the main body of this Subscription Agreement,
            and a Service Order or any terms for Additional Services, the Service Order or terms for
            Additional Services, as applicable, shall control solely with respect to the specific Services
            described in the Service Order or such terms. Except as expressly provided herein, this
            agreement may not be modified except in a writing executed by both parties. Except where this
            Agreement permits e-mail notice, all notices under this Agreement shall be in writing and sent
            either through recognized overnight courier or via first-class mail, return receipt requested, to the
            party at the address provided in the latest Service Order or otherwise provided via notice; notices
            are effective upon receipt. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and all
            disputes shall be governed by, the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without giving
            effect to the conflicts of laws rules thereof. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for the adjudication of
            any disputes relating to this Agreement shall be in the state and federal courts (including the
            appellate courts) for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the parties hereby consent to the
            jurisdiction and venue of such courts. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior
            written consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however,
            that iQ Media may, without consent, utilize subcontractors to perform its obligations under this
            Agreement and either party may assign this Agreement to (i) an affiliate or (ii) a successor in
            connection with a merger or a sale of substantially all its assets.
